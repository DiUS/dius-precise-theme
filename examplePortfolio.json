I have worked with startups from the U.S. and lead a local tech team to implement what has turned out to be core products for broadband systems in Australia, followed by project managing the development of products for big picture initiatives like the NBN.

I’m particularly aware of the need to mitigate risk as projects transition into the delivery phase.\n\nOutside direct project work, I’m Chair of the Steering Committee for Random Hacks of Kindness (RHoK) – of which DiUS is a regional partner and strong supporter. Google, Microsoft, Yahoo! and the World Bank founded RHoK to create a community of volunteers to build applications to support humanitarian aid and disaster relief. I’ve led a volunteer RHoK team to design, build, open-source and make available a fire information website for the Warrandyte Community Association.\n\nIn addition, I’m passionate about Creating Shared Value – which combines creating value for companies with adding value to the broader society. In other words, everyone wins rather than one sector making gains at someone else’s expense.\n\nI’m also heavily involved in the technology community and have spoken twice at the Agile Australia conference – a leading event for the Agile development community in this country. In addition, I’ve presented at the Business Analysts’ World Conference in 2012 and the LAST (Lean, Agile, Systems Thinking) Conference 2013.\n\nThrough my Masters studies I have had the opportunity to explore a variety of aspects of IT management and governance.

The Façade, written in Grails, was created to provide APDM better endpoints than the back-end system thus simplifying the communication and reducing bandwidth consumption from the apps.\n\nA key achievement was to develop a suite of \"acceptance tests\". These were executed against every new release of the third party server-side application, which gave the organisation confidence that there had been no regressions that originated from that release. This in turn minimised time lost attempting to diagnose defects that were not originating from the iOS application we were developing.\n\nAnother important achievement was the simplification of the Multifactor Authentication process. By masking some of the steps in the Façade we were able to reduce complexity on APDM and test the feature by applying mocking mechanisms.",
